NOTE: 
Comparing to #2. List of continents
When you're just listing the continents once each without any aggregation, 
"
SELECT DISTINCT(continent) FROM world 
"
works perfectly.
The difference is that in the original query, you're trying to do two things at once:

List each continent once (using DISTINCT)
Count countries for each continent (using COUNT)

When you're combining an aggregate function like COUNT with non-aggregated columns, PostgreSQL requires you to use GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT. This is because PostgreSQL needs to know how to group the records before performing the count.
So while:
"
SELECT DISTINCT(continent) FROM world
"
works fine for just listing continents,
For counting countries per continent, you need:
"
SELECT continent, COUNT(name) 
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
"
The GROUP BY approach is designed specifically for these aggregate operations, 
where you want to organize data into groups and then perform calculations on each group.

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
GROUP BY continent


--#7.Counting big countries in each continent

/*
For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.
*/

SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population > 10000000
GROUP BY continent



--#8. Counting big continents

/*
List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.

The HAVING clause is designed to filter groups based on aggregate conditions, not on individual row values.
The key difference is using WHERE instead of HAVING. 
The WHERE clause filters individual rows before they're grouped, 
while HAVING filters groups after aggregation. 
Since you want to count countries that individually have populations â‰¥ 10 million, 
you need to use WHERE.

SELECT continent 
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING sum(population) > 100000000
